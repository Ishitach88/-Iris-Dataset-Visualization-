# Plotly Iris Dataset Visualization 



In this project, I used Plotly Express to visually explore the famous Iris flower dataset. I aimed to practice interactive data visualization techniques and better understand the relationships between different flower species and their physical attributes.

Imported Libraries

Used pandas and numpy for data handling (though pandas was mainly used).

Used plotly.express for creating interactive plots.

Loaded the Dataset

First attempted to read a CSV from Google Drive.

Then switched to using Plotly's built-in iris dataset for consistency and ease.

Visualized the Data Using Plotly Express:

Scatter Plot: Compared sepal_width and sepal_length across the 3 species using color-coding.

 Bar Plot: Visualized average measurements across species using bars.

Histogram: Showed the distribution of sepal_width and sepal_length across species.

Insights from Visuals

Different iris species show distinct patterns in sepal dimensions.

Setosa species tends to have smaller sepal lengths and wider sepals than others.

These plots help in distinguishing species based on flower measurements.

Why Plotly?

Plotly offers interactive and hoverable charts, which makes data analysis more engaging and insightful than static visuals.
